The template structure of the receiver contact list file is as follows.

| contactPhoneNumber | contactEmailAddress | contactTokenJson1..6 | 
| - | - | - | 
| receiver mobile number | receiver email address | {"contactType": "contacts_type", "contact": "push_token" } |

International SMS is sent in concatenated messages based on encoding and the number of characters.

Concatenated Message feature is provided or limited depending on the number of body characters, encoding, and support from your overseas Telecom Service Provider.
* If Concatenated Message is not supported, it can be received by the device in several short messages.
* The header that is added to the process of creating the Concatenated Message takes up space (approximately 6 bytes) in the message body during the process of message Concatenation, reducing the number of characters that can be entered.
* It will be charged based on the number of messages connected.

| Encoding | Charge for 1 case | Charge for 2 cases | Charge for 3 cases | Charge for 4 cases | Charge for 5 cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
