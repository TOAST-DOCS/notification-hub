## Flow

Flow is the feature of sending messages to various message channels according to their reception results. For example, you can increase reception rates while saving money by sending notifications according to their reception results, such as push, email, and text.

3. Click the **+** button to add a flow step.
4. Drag the added flow step to adjust the sending order and select a message channel.
