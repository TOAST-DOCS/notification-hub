### Creating Accounts and Channels

Refer to the following topics to create and log in to your account.

* Access Kakao Business, go to the login page and create an account.
* It is recommended to sign up as a corporate representative or by public email. (You can log in to the person in charge's personal KakaoTalk account email, but there are cases where channel transfer is required when the person in charge is absent/resigned.)

Create a channel by referring to the following items.

* The channel name is a name that is exposed on channel home and the channel name and the corporate name on the business registration document are set the same. Names that are not related to the business sector may be reasons for rejection during the screening stage of the ‘business channel’ review.
* Search ID is the ID displayed when searching on KakaoTalk app. Once set, the search ID cannot be changed.
* You can also set up your profile picture after channel registration.

### Set Kakao talk Channel 
After the channel is opened, set up the channel information and apply for the business channel by referring to the items below.

1. Select the channel opened in KakaoTalk Channel Management Center. Set channel disclosure and allow to search to ‘ON.’

2. Request to switch to a business channel. Once all information has been attached/ entered and the application is complete, the transition will be decided through a review. (It will be reviewed by Kakao and will take 2-3 business days.)
    * Business registration card and employment certificate (representative ID card). Documents will be required for submission by industry.
    * Please refer to the personal information masking guide when submitting documents. If masking is omitted, the review will be rejected.
    * In the case of mail order sales, medical device sales, and health functional food sales, a declaration certificate needs to be attached.
    * If the company name and channel name of business information entered are different, please attach additional information for review.
